## Sudoku-Solver
This is my implementation of a Sudoku solver with a graphical user interface. It allows the user to enter in a puzzle as a string, load it into the program, and solve it using a set of basic solving algorithms, backtracking, or manual solution entry.

## Motivation
This project was created as a learning exercise with several goals in mind:

First was to familiarize myself with creating a GUI in Python. I have worked with Python in the past but only have done very simple graphical interfaces. I wanted to learn a GUI framework (for this instance, I chose Kivy) and practice managing a more complex interface.

Second, I wanted to get more comfortable working with Pandas dataframes. In my previous projects using Pandas, I was never fully understood methods such as .loc[] and .itertuples(). By creating a Sudoku solver, I got much more experience with slicing and iterating through dataframe rows, columns, and smaller subsections (such as boxes) of the dataframe.

Finally, learning version control using Git was a priority. I had only ever used crude forms of version control in the past: learning the Git workflow helped greatly in managing the code base and gave me confidence to try more radical refactoring solutions.
